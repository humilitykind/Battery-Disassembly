# **Battery-Disassembly**

### **Automated Battery Disassembly using Computer Vision and Task planning.**
- Pretrained YOLOv5 with custom annotated screw data of 4 classes and hosted it on Roboflow.
- Saved the weights as `best_weights.pt` after pretraining on Colab and transferred them to a local machine for USB 3.2 port access.
- Performed screw detection using the pretrained YOLOv5 on static images.
- Calibrated the Intel RealSense D435i camera for frame-by-frame inference.


### **_Next Steps_**

- Introduce depth and relative positioning functionalities.
- Ensure synergy with hardware for real-time use cases.
- Integrate results with task planning algorithms.
